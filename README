Image/Embroidery version 0.2
=============================

This module can be used to read, write and (with GD)
display embroidery data files. It currently only supports
Tajima DST files, but if there is any interest it could
be expanded to deal with other formats. In its current form
it isn't ideal for creating or modifying patterns, but
I'm reluctant to put much effort into it until someone
tells me they are using it.
